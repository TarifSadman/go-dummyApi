# Go Dummy API

This is a simple RESTful API built with Go that provides information about students and their courses. The project demonstrates basic web server functionality, handling HTTP requests, and serving JSON responses.
Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/TarifSadman/go-dummyApi.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd go-student-api
   ```

3. Run the project:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   The server will start on http://localhost:8080.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /students**: Returns a list of students with their courses.
- **GET /students/{id}**: Returns a specific student based on the provided ID.

## Example Usage

- Access the list of students: [http://localhost:8080/students](http://localhost:8080/students)
- Access a specific student (replace `{id}` with an actual student ID): [http://localhost:8080/students/{id}](http://localhost:8080/students/{id})
